	<p><i>Srinagar: In the wake of the increasing terror attacks, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) has beefed up the security in Jammu and Kashmir. Many CRPF personnels have been deployed in the area to ensure security. The decision has been taken following the review discussions with the administration last day. The soldiers have been deployed in Rajouri and Poonch regions.</i></p></div>
	<p><span style="color: blue;"> CRPF has also informed that the village guards will be provided with weapons training to counter the terrorist attacks. Officials also clarified that many families can be saved from such attacks by providing weapons training.

    People with guns opened fire on houses in Rajouri district last day. Seven people, including two children, lost their lives in the terrorist attack. The attack took place against three houses in Upper Dangri village, which is eight kilometres away from Rajouri town. This is the second attack on the locals after 16 December when two locals were killed outside the camp.

    Last year, the Centre had launched a plan to provide weapons training to local residents in Jammu and Kashmir. The plan came into effect on 15 August. Earlier, under the scheme, the army and police had trained selected villagers.</span></p>
