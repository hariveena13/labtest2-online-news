The procedures are ahead of implementing the concept of ‘One India, One Election’. Migrant workers will also get the benefits of the scheme. The target is a substantial increase in the voting percentage.</p>
    	<p>The Election Commission’s aim is to deal with those who are unable to vote in their own constituencies,  with the help of technology. The Election Commission will introduce a voting machine in which votes can be cast in the elections held in various states of India.</p>
    	<p>Technically, the commission has successfully completed the procedures for the voting machine. After explaining the draft plan to the recognized political parties, the commission will complete other related steps. The aim of the commission is to use such voting machines from the coming Lok Sabha elections.</p>

    	<h3>Afghan stayed fearful on the New Year Eve: The attack took place outside the military airport in Kabul</h3>
    	<p><img src="C:\Users\ANU\Desktop\HTML\labetes2\pic6.gif" alt="military" width="1200" height="500"></p>
    <div style="font-size: 25px;">
    	<p><strong><i>Kabul:</i></strong> Terrorist attack took place outside the military airport at Kabul in Afghanistan. About 10 people were killed in the incident.</p>
    	<p>The incident took place around eight o’clock this morning. Afghan Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Abdul Nafi Thakor has informed about this. More than 20 people were injured in the attack. The Taliban announced that they have started an investigation over the incident.</p>

        <p>The explosion took place at the gate of the airport. A device placed there exploded. No one has yet claimed responsibility for the incident. However, the initial conclusion is that the Islamic State is behind the attack.</p>

        <p>After the Taliban came to power, terrorist attacks in Afghanistan are becoming a common incident. The Taliban had claimed that the security will be  increased in the country after coming to power. But this argument is undermined by the continuous terrorist attacks. Last month, Chinese citizens were also injured in the firing by Islamic State terrorists.</p>

In addition to Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, the cabinet is supported by far-right national religious parties. 54 people voted against Netanyahu’s government.

    	<h3>Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Review: <u>It's a Lot -- in a Good Way</u></h3>
    	<p><img src="C:\Users\ANU\Desktop\HTML\labetes2\pic10.gif" alt="Samsung S23" width="1200" height="675"></p>
    <div style="font-size: 25px; ">
    	<p><b>The Galaxy S23 Ultra builds on Samsung's strengths and improves on the camera. But the new phone is not a radical upgrade from the S22 Ultra.</b></p>
    	<p>Samsung wants the Galaxy S23 Ultra to be the go-to camera for cinematographers and photographers. I'm certainly not a professional filmmaker, nor do I consider myself to be a shutterbug. But after using the Galaxy S23 Ultra for several days, it's clear the new camera upholds the areas in which Samsung already excels -- like low-light photography -- and pushes those strengths a little further.</p> 

        <p>The 1,29,000 INR Galaxy S23 Ultra will be available on Feb. 17 alongside the rest of Samsung's new phone lineup, which includes the 79,000 Galaxy S23 and 89,000 Galaxy S23 Plus. Like last year's Galaxy S22 Ultra, the S23 Ultra's giant screen, high price and souped-up camera may be too much for the average person. </p>
        <p>The name "Ultra" says it all; this phone is for people who want a phone that's over the top. Compared to the Galaxy S23 and S23 Plus, the Ultra offers a closer zoom magnification than most people will probably need, a stylus that stores inside the phone and a massive 6.8-inch screen that's larger than both those of the iPhone 14 Pro Max and Google Pixel 7 Pro. You might not need all that excess, but after using this phone for a few days, I wouldn't blame you for wanting them. </p>

               <li>No improvements to fast charging</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Samsung largely achieves its goal of providing a deluxe phone with an excellent camera and giant display. But it isn't perfect. That high price is hard to ignore, and photos taken on the Galaxy S23 Ultra don't always look as natural as those captured on the iPhone 14 Pro or Pixel 7 Pro. </p>
